## 🔍 Overview

Linux Security Toolkit (LST) is a comprehensive collection of shell scripts designed to enhance the security of Linux systems. These scripts automate the process of identifying vulnerabilities, applying fixes, and maintaining a robust security posture.

## 🚀 Features

- Vulnerability scanning
- Automated fixes for common security issues
- System hardening
- Compliance checks (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.)
- Detailed reporting and logging

## 📁 Script Directory
create a very detailed readme.md regarding shell sscripts (in the other files) for checking vulnerabilities  in linux systems and fixing stuff. include some designs (via text as decor)

Certainly! I'll create a detailed README.md file for shell scripts that check vulnerabilities in Linux systems and fix issues. I'll include some text-based decorative elements as well. Here's the updated README.md:

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LST.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the LST directory:
   ```
   cd LST
   ```
3. Make scripts executable:
   ```
   chmod +x **/*.sh
   ```

## 📊 Usage

Run the main script to perform a full system check and apply fixes:

```
./lst_main.sh
```

Or run individual scripts as needed:

```
./scan/vulnerability_scan.sh
./fix/patch_manager.sh
./harden/ssh_hardening.sh
```

## 🔒 Key Security Checks

1. **Network Security**
   - Open ports
   - Firewall configuration
   - Intrusion detection

2. **System Security**
   - User and group management
   - File permissions
   - Service configurations

3. **Application Security**
   - Outdated software
   - Known vulnerabilities
   - Secure configurations

4. **Compliance**
   - Industry-standard compliance checks
   - Custom policy enforcement

## 📝 Reporting

LST generates comprehensive reports after each run, including:

- Vulnerabilities detected
- Fixes applied
- Compliance status
- Recommendations for manual intervention

Reports are stored in the `reports/` directory with timestamps.

## 🔄 Continuous Monitoring

Set up a cron job to run LST regularly:

```
0 2 * * * /path/to/LST/lst_main.sh > /dev/null 2>&1
```

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

While LST aims to improve system security, it is not a substitute for professional security audits or expert knowledge. Always review changes and consult with IT security professionals for critical systems.
